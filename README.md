# AI powered 3d web site

A small app for studying OpenAI image resources. This app was developed following the [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZqEa8fTxypQ) from the JS Mastery youtube channel

with it is possible to include images in a 3d model of a t-shirt, as a logo, or as the entire surface of the clothing, it is also possible to ask the AI (OpenAI) to generate an image, using natural language, and allows you to apply this image as a logo, or all over the surface
